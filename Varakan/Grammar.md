# Nouns
~~Nouns possess 3 genders, Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter
Neuter is reserved for inanimate nouns, while masculine and feminine are assigned to the animate nouns.~~
>[!warning] lets think about this one
>the noun gender system is gonna be really hard to squeeze into what ive already got here unless youre fine with noun genders being assigned basically at random like in german

Nouns can take on the Nominative, Accusative, and Genitive cases, marked by prefix.
ge~ - accusative

ki~ - genitive

Noun plurality is marked with infixes, however there exists the ~ne suffix which also signifies plurality but can be used comparatively like the determiner more in English when used with a noun that does not take the ~ne suffix in its plural form.
~ne can also imply a grouping of something, such as in the word vakene (tribe) which is vake (people) suffixed with ~ne.
The pattern is fairly regular, with the stressed syllable receiving the vowel infix
a/i ~> e
e/u ~> e (use ~ne suffix)
e.g: varaka (sg), vareka (pl)
neenat (sg), neenatne (pl)
#### Common constructions
~ka - Forms agent nouns
e.g: Varaka, formed from vara (to have to), meaning literally "one who must", implying a sense of communal duty, meaning comrade/brother.

~me - Forms gerunds from verbs and state of being nouns (like English ~iness) from adjectives
e.g: Rekeme, formed from reke (to help), meaning literally "the helping", which of course means help, assistance, or aid.

# Verbs
Verbs conjugate for person but only in formal contexts, in everyday conversation the infinitive is used, with case marking as well as inference allowing for the speaker to still be understood.

Past tense is marked with the particle dhu /ðʌ/ after the verb.

e.g:
!aake /ǀaːkɛ/ - hunt, to hunt
tive !aake - I hunt
tive !aaketi - I hunt (formal)
tive !aaketi dhu gegaate - I hunted you(sg) (formal)

Verbs fall into 3 "classes" that determine how they conjugate formally:
~ke verbs
Conjugated formally by placing the pronoun after the verb, but before any tense markers.
~ra verbs
Does not conjugate.
~ta
The least common verb form

The particle ti functions like English "with", being used to show that something is the instrument of a verb, placed after the instrument and before the verb.
e.g: kharete ti !aake - to hunt using a knife

For the comitative case, like English "with" in the sense of "in the company of", instead use the particle se, placed before the accompanier.
e.g:  se varaka !aake - to hunt with a comrade

# Adjectives, adverbs and determiners
Adjective are placed after nouns and do not agree with noun case.
Qualitative adjectives usually end with ~ye, ~ya, ~ge, and ~re.
Exceptions do occur, especially in more common adjectives such as colours.

Common time adverbs are irregular, while descriptive adverbs end in ~ni.
Adverbs are placed before 

Determiners are almost entirely irregular, aside from demonstratives.

#### Common constructions
Adjectives can be formed from nouns (like English -ful, -y, by replacing the final vowel with ~a~ and then adding the suffix ~sa
e.g: vakegata /vəkɛgatə/ - blood, vakegasa /vəkɛgasə/ - bloody
arage /əragɛ/ - peace, aragasa /əragasə/ - peaceful

Adjectives can be converted to adverbs by adding ~ni.
e.g: niye /nijɛ/ - cute, niyeni /nijeni/ - cutely
