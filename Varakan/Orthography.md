The orthography generally follows the IPA, but as to ensure compatibility with most English keyboards, several characters are swapped out for digraphs or other characters.

/θ/ - th
/ð/ - dh
/ʃ/ - sh
/ʒ/ - gh
/j/ - y
/x/ - kh
Dialectical /w/ may sometimes be reflected in writing, being noted as w instead of v.
/ŋ/ does not appear outside of being at the end of a word and so is written as n.

The vowel sounds are also written accordingly:
/a/ - a
/e/ - e
/ɛ/ - e (when unstressed)
/ə ~ ʌ/ - a (when unstressed)
/ə ~ ʌ/ - u
/i/ - i

This romanization system can be confusing but it is a product of its time and spelling reform has yet to occur.
The Varakan script does not have these issues but is unsupported by this data entry system.

//NOTE
//Add Varakan character support to Atlas encoding

Vowel length is indicated by duplicating the character. Two of the vowel indicates a long sound.
/aː/ - aa
/a/ - a
