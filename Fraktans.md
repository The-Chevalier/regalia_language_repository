## Overview

The Fraktans (Varakus) are a species of thermoregulating xenoreptilians that are native to the planet [[Vultor]]. Fraktans are found exclusively on the [[Mainland]] continent, and inhabit the majority of the landmass. 

Fraktans have existed for many, many generations. Fraktan society is extensively tribal. Despite their large population and incredible feats as a sentient species, they reside in highly territorial enclaves, hunting and maiming each other more often than the prey they stalk.

## Anatomy

Fraktans are bipeds with two limb pairs, differing from the hexapodal body plans of most vultoran life. They are characterized by their large, bulky frames and scaly skin. Fraktans have tough keratin plating on their faces, punctuated by a turtle-like beak. Their heads usually have a pair of triangular, tapering horns, though horn shapes may vary between individuals. Their ears are typically pointy, and they grow feathery manes, most of which is a down-like texture.

>[!info] Egg Laying Behavior
>Fraktans are oviparous, laying clutches of 2-3 eggs at a time. These eggs have a leathery, textured casing which helps in regulating their internal conditions. Eggs are kept suspended in a pool of milk-like fluid, which is produced by mixing regurgitation of partially digested food in water. 

Fraktans age at about half the rate of humans. A 6 year old fraktan is the equivalent of a 12 year old human. Fraktan adolescence usually spans from year 6 to year 16. 

>[!warning] Needs Rewriting
>This does correlate with their life expectancy as well, as a vast majority of younger fraktans are trained as warriors, and usually die as warriors. Older fraktan populations are skewed towards females, as they tend to live in relative safety in their villages, protected by the predominantly male warrior class. This often results in matriarchal structures, as the females raise broods and tend more to upkeep and politics.

## Society 

Fraktans originally gathered in groups to form communal broods, which would vastly improve survivability. As society progressed, broods became the center of political and societal discourse.
